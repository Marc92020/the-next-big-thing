  <h1>the next big thing - a poorly made gaming portal</h1>
  <p>games are added when the game trend changes in class</p>
  <h5>current game trend: pokemon clicker on scratch</h5>
  <br>
  <h2><a href="Run3Editor.html">run 3 (fake version)</a></h2>
  <p>fake version because the real one is blocked on the school internet for whatever reason idk but the fake version is bad</p>
  <h2><a href="url">geometry dash (scratch but not griffpatch's i think)</a></h2>
  <p>its not griffpatch's but the embedding is kind of cool so thats one good thing</p>
  <h2><a href="url">pokemom clicker (scratch)</a></h2>
  <p>some pokemon clicker that i played years before my classmates just to test out my autoclicker.</p>
  <p>not same embedding as geometry dash because this one was embedded by me</p>
